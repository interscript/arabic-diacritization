= Literature and Codes

Last updated: 2021-06.

We review only the more advanced technologies.

Older solutions used rules based approaches.

Deep Learning was applied relatively to the problem of diacritization, gradually
getting better results than rules based approaches.

== Research ideas

Here we just mention some 2021-ish ideas mentioned in the recent papers above:

* Transformer-based Encoders
* Byte-pair-encodings
* Improve Injected Hints Method (train with semi diacritised data)
* More Interpretable Attention Weights
* Deep belief networks
* More data and data processing
