### Libraries
#### POS Tagger
1. [Hazm](https://github.com/sobhe/hazm)
Has Java support, which might be useful.
There are available trained models [here](https://github.com/sobhe/hazm/releases/download/v0.5/resources-0.5.zip) (2016 -- Now)
It can do the pre-processing for us using the Normalizer function, and do the PoS tagging using  POSTagger function.
2. [Perpos](https://github.com/mhbashari/perpos)
Older library (? -- 2014).
3. [Persian POS Tagger](https://github.com/AminMozhgani/Persian_POS_Tagger) (? -- 2014).
