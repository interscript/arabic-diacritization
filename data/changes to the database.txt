1. I converted all instances of ي and ك to ی and ک.

2. I added PoS tags to the last two instances of ی since they're for verbs

3. I added a row to the affixes: نمی. I believe this will help. Will reconsider if it turns out to cause bugs somehow.

4. I added PoS tags for ید.

5. I added PoS tags for یم.

6. I added a row for ن which is pronounced /an/ because it didn't exist in the affixes while it's necessary for transliterating words like خوردن and خوابیدن that are called مصدر in Farsi.
