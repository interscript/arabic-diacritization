1. Converted all instances of ي and ك to ی and ک.

2. Added PoS tags to the last two instances of ی since they're for verbs

3. Added a row to the affixes: نمی. I believe this will help. Will reconsider if it turns out to cause bugs somehow.

4. Added PoS tags for ید.

5. Added PoS tags for یم.

6. Added a row for ن which is pronounced /an/ because it didn't exist in the affixes while it's necessary for transliterating words like خوردن and خوابیدن that are called مصدر in Farsi.

7. Added a row for the verb root «آ» in entries.

8. Changed the frequency for نما as a verb from 5000 to 5001 in its /namA/ form.

9. Added a row for /yam/ transliteration of یم in verbs.

10. Changed the frequency of kon for the word کن to 5001 since I think the present tense of کردن is used way more than کندن!

11. Added an instance for each letter with T as their PoS in entries, basically, for when we have to go for a letter by itself. So, it's basically a letter to letter mapping.

12. Added a row for the affix ست when it's pronounced /st/.

13. Changed the transliteration of اسماً from 'esmAn to 'esman

14. Changed the transliteration of استدلالاً from 'estedlAllan to 'estedlAlan

15. Omitted all instances of ً  (tanvin /an/) from entries. 224 words were normalized.

16. Changed the frequency of گ with T as its PoS (item 11 in this list) from 1 to 3 since Ab (abbreviation) had a frequency of 2 and would have priority otherwise.

17. Changed the frequency of /'arz/ for عرض to 31 so it has a higher frequency than /'araz/

18. Changed digits 0 to 9 in Farsi entries to the Farsi versions of them so they change to corresponding English ones.

19. Added a row for آ with T PoS and another for ئ transliterated /'/
