1. The word نیایشگرانی is transliterated /nayeyaSgarAnayi/ This is so odd. Can't tell how that's happened. 

2. The word پیتر is transliterated پیtar while پیت exists in the entries. So, seems like the code is not looking for the biggest substring of the word that exists in entries. It's just finding the biggest substring starting in the end of words. This whole starting in the end, which was actually in the beginning of the string for rule 20, doesn't apply to the last rule. So, we just need to look for the biggest substring. I know this makes the code even slower, but this is what works best.

3. There's also another bug hidden somewhere. The word پاری is transliterated پاreyi. The whole first part of word being left in Farsi aside, the second part, ری, exists in entries as rey, so where does the /i/ in the end come from?!

4. Another strange case is دوهواپیمای 
Other than the code not looking for the biggest substring, the process in which /adueuAپیم'eyi/ is produced is a mystery to me. How  is that output produced? I think there are some serious bugs mostly connected to the algorithm or more probably implementation of the last rule. We gotta take a look into that.
